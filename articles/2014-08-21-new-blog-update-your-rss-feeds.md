Today, we relaunch our [Blog](http://blog.nodesecurity.io), moving it away from Tumblr, in a effort to empower more people contribute with their security related proposed articles, with a [simple issue or pull request](https://github.com/nodesecurity/nodesecurity-blog).

Please make sure that your RSS feed continues working, so you can get the latest news about the Node Security Project.
