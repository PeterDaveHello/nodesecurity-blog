**Name / Handle?**  
Luca Carettoni  
  
**Where are the best places to find you online?**  
My Twitter account ([@\_ikki)](https://twitter.com/_ikki) is the best way to reach me out. Together with other longtime friends, we have a blog [http://blog.nibblesec.org/,](http://blog.nibblesec.org/,) where we mainly talk about web security.  
  
**What do you do professionally?**  
I've been working in security for nearly nine years, doing penetration test and vulnerability research.

Recently, I've joined Addepar - an amazing startup where I am responsible for infrastructure and product security.   
  
**How did you get introduced to node.js?**  
As an emerging technology, Node.js is getting a lot of attention here in the SF Bay area. It's impossible to attend local tech meetups without talking about Node.

My real hands-on experience started just a few months ago,  while evaluating the framework for an upcoming project. Since then, I've started playing with it and security has been my main focus.   
  
**What interested you in helping with the node security project?**  
Securing the framework is the first step to build a reliable and secure application. Together with other colleagues, we've started reporting and fixing bugs in common Node modules as part of an ongoing effort.

In the meantime, I've started reading the NodeJS codebase to understand a bit more about core libraries and the interaction with Google's V8 Javascript engine.

It's all incredibly interesting from the engineering perspective, but it's also a very time consuming activity. The codebase is getting bigger and complex, modules are created or modified at the speed of light.  
  
When Adam announced the NodeSecurity project, I was extremely happy to hear that other people were trying to tackle this problem.   
Joining the effort and building a strong community of security practitioners and developers is important to improve the security of the Node ecosystem. This is going to benefit all of us - from small companies to big players.   
  
**Anything else you want to mention?**  
NodeSecurity is a great opportunity for making developers and security folks working together on improving the platform. The ticketing system is currently structured in a way that allows you to start auditing a module in a few minutes, without complex setup. Summing up: it's fun, you get to work with a new technology and contribute to something bigger. Join the [nodesecurity-auditors](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nodesecurity-auditors) group!
