#title: Mistakes! Keep Calm & Carry On
#type: text

There is this gut wrenching feeling when I come across a post that mentions a vulnerability in a site that I have done an assessment for. If you perform web application assessments chances are you have experienced the same cringe-worthy feeling.   
  
If you are a \[I want to say proprietor of a web application or developer but that sounds strange and I can't think of the right words\], read on, there are lessons to be learned for you as well.   
  
Here are a few steps I take to deal with the pain and resolve the situation.   
  
First, take a step back and calm down  
  
Take a deep breath, everyone makes mistakes, in order to learn from them we must first do the hard job of acknowledging them. To bury your head in the sand in an attempt to ignore it would be like all the other vendors that you have reported problems to never fixing the issues you identified. I hope you can understand just how frustrating that is.   
  
Let it motivate you to learn more about something you probably thought you knew a lot about. Maybe you aren't going to learn something technical about the actual vulnerability, but about your assessment process and how it could be better and more thorough.   
  
Maybe you didn't make a mistake.   
  
As assessment is typically a time boxed, resource constrained, moment-in-time look at a complex system. It's possible that this is new research that simply wasn't available during your assessment (hint: go learn about it). Applications rarely stay static, so maybe there was new code committed which made the application vulnerable after you did your assessment.   
  
Do what we do   
  
Recommend, upfront, that your client should use multiple vendors in a rotating capacity. This ensures that there are more eyes on the lookout for potential problems and risks. I think bug bounties on mature apps also help fill this gap, but most clients are just not up for that challenge.   
  
Remember, you are human and you will miss something, that's okay. You owe it to your clients to have their best interest in mind.   
  
Finally, let your customer know.   
  
The author of the vulnerability may not have disclosed the issue to the vendor. You should let the vendor know about the issue, acknowledge the above and provide them with the information and recommendations to resolve the problem. It's little things like this that will allow your client to see that you care about their success even if you aren't getting paid.   
  
I'm a driven person and you probably are, too. It's a giant blow to the ego to have someone pwn an app you've tested. But we all acknowledge that security is a continuous process, not something you can set and forget.  
  
At the end of the day, we're humans and so are our clients. We all know what it's like to make mistakes and we also know those who are most apt to try and avoid mistakes in the future are those who can admit them.
