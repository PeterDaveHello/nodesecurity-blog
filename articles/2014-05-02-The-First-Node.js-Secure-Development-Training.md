Just a few days ago the ^lift security team hosted the first Node.js Secure Development Training at Portland, OR. This training is the culmination of years helping teams to ship better secure code, exposing best practices and techniques, helping developers be more confident in themselves while building web apps.

The training was hosted at The Cleaners, an amazing space in downtown Portland.

Despite the beautiful weather for Portland, everyone stated engaged learning about how to find, exploit and fix many different kinds of vulnerabiltiies that plague web apps. 

We're pretty proud of this group of people that spent the day with us to help themselves become better developers than they were the day before.
