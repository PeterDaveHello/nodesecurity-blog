**  
**The Node Security project is a mashup of two worlds, builders and breakers. Stephen is one of the builders. He's one of the many helping us build our custom portal app, which you will probably get to see at [NodePDX](http://nodepdx.org/) ;)

**Name / Handle?**  
  
Stephen Rivas, Jr; my handle is usually "sprjrx" which is the first username I ever had. My initials didn't meet the 6 character minimum so the X seemed like the coolest option.  
  
**Where are the best places to find you online?**  
  
My twitter account ([@sprjrx](https://twitter.com/sprjrx)) most likely. GitHub ([sprjr](https://github.com/sprjr)) would be next, ...LinkedIn. I'm hoping to get my own site / blog back online again..."Soon"((tm))  
  
**What do you professionally?**  
  
I am a founder at a development studio in Orlando, [Zeunic](http://zeunic.com/). We've had a few start up apps we've worked on, and are still trying to simultaneously foster a Node.js community \*and\* break out into its scene in a big way.  
  
**How did you get introduced to node.js?**  
  
Awhile back somewhere in 0.2.something a friend asked me to help him figure out why he couldn't get mongoose and, I think derby (?), linked up and working. We couldn't even figure out why the server would shut off when we closed terminal --it was a total fail. Every article we read was "Posted 5 hours ago" so we got pretty frustrated. We picked it back up in 0.4.x and used it for our final project for school; still some hiccups but we've loved it since.  
  
**What interested you in helping with the node security project?**  
  
TL;DR -- to contribute to the node community, learn things from others, and hopefully help make a positive impact on what this project aims to do for node / npm authors.  
  
I've been using Node.js since 0.2-ish, but not in a "good" way if you ask me. I've used a lot of open source modules, I've read tons of answers on Stack questions, and countless other blog posts. I've seen others put on great meet ups and make lots of neat apps. This community is great, but some times I feel like I've been more of a leech than a positive influence and contributor.  
  
When the opportunity came up to help with the Node Security project, fortunately I had  been working on some other things that could easily be used to help in some areas to kick off the project. I also saw others jumping in and figured that I could learn a thing or two just by getting out there and either watching, or by contributing and getting critiqued.  
  
Plus I really like Charlie Robbin's "all open source everything" attitude. I want to make the world a better place, especially here in the Node.js circles.  
  
**If you could suggest one thing to node.js developers to improve the security of things they build what would that be?**  
  
I'm still kind of a newbie in terms of security. I will say that I've always felt like there are people in the community who will look at your code, point you in the right direction, or offer tips and tricks -- all you have to do is ask. They are a pretty great bunch when it comes to helping out.  
  
**Anything else you want to mention?**

  
This project is another example of what makes Node.js, and it's community really awesome. Really glad I've been able to contribute thus far. Oh, and I'm always looking for work / discussion with Node -- so feel free to get in touch. (Especially on Twitter!)
