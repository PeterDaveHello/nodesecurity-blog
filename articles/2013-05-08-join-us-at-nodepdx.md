Next week [Adam Baldwin](https://twitter.com/adam_baldwin) is going to be at [NodePDX](http://nodepdx.org/) 2013 (May 16th & 17th) introducing the node security project and getting as much feedback from the community as possible.

So please [grab a ticket](http://nodepdx.eventbrite.com/#) while they are still available, get your node on, listen to some great speakers, and give us your thoughts.

If that's not enticing enough, Adam will also have [stickers](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BJX2iP9CEAAlcw8.jpg:large), if you ask nicely.
