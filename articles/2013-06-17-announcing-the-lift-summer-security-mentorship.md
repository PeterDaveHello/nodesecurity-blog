#title: Announcing the ^Lift Summer Security Mentorship
#type: text

I grew up in a very small farming community and was drawn to technology at a young age. After getting caught hacking into the local BBS when I was 16, instead of getting in trouble I was given an amazing opportunity (which I didn't realize until much later in life).

The person that ran the BBS gave me a job. He taught me all about building and fixing computers, running a small business, and of course, he put my curiosity to work as well.

I got my feet wet learning about reverse engineering, using softice. I think my first exercise was bypassing the neopaint nag screen, among other things. I was taught in a safe environment where he knew that I wasn't going to get into any trouble, but I could continue to learn.

Over the last few months I have sought out local students and individuals that have both a passion for security and the desire to learn, and recruited them for a summer mentorship at ^Lift Security. My hope is to provide them with the same opportunities to grow, learn, and explore security in a similarly interactive and safe environment, like the one I had when I was their age.

I'm excited for things to begin today and am confident the mentees will have some amazing stories, vulns, and research to share by the end of the summer.
