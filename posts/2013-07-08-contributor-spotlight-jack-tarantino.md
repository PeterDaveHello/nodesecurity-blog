**Name / Handle?**

Jack Tarantino / [JacopoTarantino](https://twitter.com/JacopoTarantino)

**Where are the best places to find you online?**

I'm easy to find through my website at [[http://jacopotarantino.com](http://jacopotarantino.com)](http://jacopotarantino.com) and I'm always on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JacopoTarantino).

**What do you professionally?**

I'm a freelance full-stack developer. I work with WordPress and node.js.

**How did you get introduced to node.js?**

I was looking for a new framework or language to get into and I decided on node.js. The prospect of using javascript on the server side and the recent advances in speed won me over. The simplicity of using only one language and the surprisingly vibrant community is what keeps me around.

**What interested you in helping with the node security project?**

Application security is extremely important and, more often than not, it's the aspect of development that is most neglected or ignored. I was looking for people to talk to about securing a new application and found this project. I'm very happy to find other people who are proactive about bringing security to the community and collaborating on projects to make them better.

**If you could suggest one thing to node.js developers to improve the security of things they build what would that be?**

Check everything! Check, check ,double check, escape, validate everything. And don't just stop at user inputs, make sure data generated by your application is what it's supposed to be. If you have your application check up on itself or run a full test suite, you can improve the stability of your application by catching bugs early.

**Anything else you want to mention?**

Node is seriously my favorite thing right now. I think it has the power to really change how we develop applications online. I'm very happy to be part of this community.
